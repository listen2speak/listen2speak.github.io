# Jeff Souza's ePortfolio

This portfolio includes two programs designed and enhanced while a student in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University.  It includes a self-assessment, a code-review and two artifacts with enhancements and narratives explaining each enhancement.  The first program is a Campsite Locator application developed during my CS-360 Mobile Architecture course.  The enhancements for this program are in software design/engineering and databases.  The second program is a simple python-based listing application that covers enhancements in it’s algorithms and data structure.
